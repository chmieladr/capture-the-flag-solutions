# EE_CTF 2024
Subdirectory that contains my step-by-step solutions to tasks from the EE Cybersecurity CTF for WUT students. 

> I managed to complete six out of nine challenges, therefore,
> I have also included the `CTF_OFFICIAL_SOLUTIONS.pdf` file with solutions provided by the authors.
> Some of my solutions differ from these!

All the challenges have been split into their corresponding subdirectories.
Each of them contains `task.md` file where you can learn what the challenge was all about along with
`solution.md` that focuses on my step-by-step solutions of them.
Other files were either provided as a part of the challenge by the hosts
or were obtained/produced during the process of solving the task.

> `failed_session` contains only a partial solution.
> For full solution, check the provided `.pdf` file as I was unable to fully solve it myself.
