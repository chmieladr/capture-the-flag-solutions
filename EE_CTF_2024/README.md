# EE_CTF 2024
Subdirectory that contains my step-by-step solutions to tasks from the EE Cybersecurity CTF for WUT students. 

> I managed to complete 6 out of 9 challenges, therefore I have also included the `CTF_OFFICIAL_SOLUTIONS.pdf` file with solutions provided by the authors. Some of my solutions differ from these ones!

All the challenges have been split into their corresponding subdirectories. Each of them contains `task.md` file where you can learn what the challenge was all about along with `solution.md` that focuses on my step-by-step solutions of them. Other files were either provided as a part of the challenge by the hosts or were obtained/produced during the process of solving the task.

> `failed_session` contains only partial solution. For full solution check the provided .pdf file as I was unable to fully solve it myself.
